	<h2>The woman behind the legend</h2>
	
	<div class='div1'>
		<P class='body1'> Annie Palmer was born in England but moved to Haiti with her parents at a young age. 
			Tragedy struck when both of her parents died of yellow fever, leaving her an orphan. 
			She was then adopted by her nanny, who was a practitioner of voodoo.</P>
		<br>
		<p class='body2'>As she grew older, Annie moved to Jamaica and married John Palmer, the owner of the Rose Hall Plantation. 
			It is said that Annie was beautiful but had a dark side. She was rumored to practice witchcraft and voodoo rituals, 
			which she learned from her nanny. It's believed that she used these practices for personal gain and to maintain control 
			over the slaves on the plantation.<br></p>

		  	  Annie's reign at Rose Hall was marked by a series of unfortunate events. It is said that she murdered her three husbands 
			  and several slave lovers. The legend tells of her cruelty and sadistic behavior, including the brutal treatment of slaves. 
			  She reportedly had a penchant for killing her lovers after using them, and her bedroom, known as the "Room of Tears," was said
			  to be the site of many deaths.</p2>
